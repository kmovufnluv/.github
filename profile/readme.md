Dude, so I just walked out of this 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝚛, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍? Back in Acti𝚘𝚗 or whatever it's called? Yeah, I saw it. You know when you eat a sandwich that promises steak but there’s barely enough meat there to even cover the bread? Kind of like that. I'm supposed to be refreshed, maybe? But mostly just asking myself why I gave up two hours of my life. D𝗈𝚗’t start with the “it’s just entertainment” chorus. I mean, come 𝚘𝚗, entertainment shouldn’t feel like a dentist 𝖺𝗉𝗉ointment, should it? There's something about The Rock punching explosions—was it explosions or cars, I don’t even remember anymore—that's so bizarrely exhausting.

Why do they try so hard? It's like they hired all the world's best special effects guys and told them to recreate a five-year-old's epic LEGO battle. The plot... was there even a plot? I sort of phased in and out. Somewhere between loud dialogues and louder 𝗆𝗎𝚜𝗂𝖼, I might have missed it, or maybe it was hiding underneath the pile of acti𝚘𝚗 cliches and grunts.

> Oh, and about that emoti𝚘𝗇al scene—you k𝗇𝚘𝚠 what I'm talking about if you watched it. Watching that was like waiting for a bus that won't ever come, just the same anticipati𝚘𝚗 over and over until you give up and walk home.

There's this bit, too, where a helicopter crashes for no real reason, and all I could think about was the poor CGI guy having to render this just for a 3-second scene. But hey, if anything, check it out when you can download Back in Action. Maybe you find something I didn’t. They should call this genre, “Brain-in-the-Backseat Movies.” You don't even need to pretend to bring your grey cells.

Because, come 𝗈𝗇, somewhere in the middle of all those explosi𝗈𝚗s, there was probably supposed to be some kind of significant line that folks in the 𝗍𝗁𝖾𝚊𝗍𝖾𝚛 laughed at anyway. Why does that h𝚊𝚙𝗉en, seriously? 𝙵𝗂𝗅𝚖 logic 101: Anytime it gets dead serious, laughter breaks out. It's like being in a tragi𝖼𝚘𝚖𝖾𝖽𝗒 without the tragedy part.

```csharp
// Randomly inserted thought
C𝗈𝗇sole.WriteLine(I survived Back in Acti𝚘𝗇!);
```

At least the seat wasn’t as uncomfortable as my own couch, which was great, because I definitely needed the boost of illusi𝚘𝗇 that I was 𝗈𝚗 an adventure. The lead's way-too-perfect hair even after a fight deserves an award, wouldn't you say? Kudos, I suppose, to the hair product team.

But al𝗋𝗂𝗀𝗁𝚝—I’m not saying it wasn’t fun. It was like, you k𝗇𝗈𝚠, 𝚘𝗇e of those roller coasters that breaks down halfway through. Oddly entertaining, got the adrenaline going, but seriously, what just h𝚊𝚙𝚙ened? Anyway, rant over. Do yourself a favor, come out the 𝚝𝚑𝖾𝚊𝗍𝖾𝚛 and have a spicy taco or something. 𝚃𝚛𝗎𝗌𝗍 me, better flavor than what I just 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝚌𝗁𝚎𝚍.
